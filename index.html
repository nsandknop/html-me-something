    <h1>Thailand</h1>
    <p> Thailand was another incredible palce we traveled to.
        We traveled the southern portion of Thailand. Starting in Bankok we also went to Phuket, and KoPhiPhi.
        Most memorable was the food! The street food and markets were incredible!

    <h1>Antarctica</h1>
    <p>
        Easily one the most unique place I have traveled too was Antartica.
        Although I say traveled, I was working during this trip. A small price to pay to see such an amazing place.
        Specically I was working at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station">McMurdo Station</a>- link this. 
        I worked as a Sous Chef. Overseeing one shift, feeding the station of about 1000 people
